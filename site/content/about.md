# Hey! I'm Hegde üåä

Welcome to my home on the internet

I love exploring challenging problems, its what keeps me working.

üè´ Currently pursuing my bachelors degree in CSE at PES Uni. Also a part of clubs like [HSP](https://homebrew.hsp-ec.xyz/about/) and [ACM](https://acmpesuecc.github.io) here at my uni and part of both the _Mentoring_ and _Design_ team.

I'm really interested in working with system level, databases, networking concepts. I'm a really huge fan of Tennis and Motersport.

Currently reasearching on _Databases_ and _Distributed Systems_ üïó. Working on a few projects in go and trying to get my way around rust. Working on the `MIT 6.5640 lab` for distributed systems.
