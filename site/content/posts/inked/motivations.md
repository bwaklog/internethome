I find the current state of apps pretty _stinky_. While there are so many available, I just can't find myself affording anything. Well it's understandable, we rely on S3 servers that in time are tremendously expensive and devs cant just live off of this. This led to the rise of the _subscription based models_ which is not really cheap. That aside, there are few apps, which provide the minimum functionality, that checks every box of requirements and yet has a monstrous price.

My mother came up to me and asked about an app that virtually *pins* tasks to the Lock Screen of her phone. Well tons of them exist, but then the problem arises once again...the good old subscription plan. 

I want to take up such challenges, but don't fully have the skillset to do this. Making the app is always free of cost, and this seems to be best for personal use. Making such FOSS applications, self hosting them or just building them for personal use to solve your daily needs is something I want to be fluid in solving.
