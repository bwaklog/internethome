My mother came up to me and asked about an app that virtually *pins* tasks to the Lock Screen of her phone. Well tons of them exist, but then the problem arises once again...the good old subscription plan.

I find the current state of apps pretty _stinky_. While there are so many available, I just can't find myself affording anything. Well it's understandable, we rely on `S3` servers that in time are tremendously expensive and devs cant just live off of this. This led to the rise of the _subscription based models_ which is not really cheap. That aside, there are few apps, which provide the minimum functionality, that checks every box of requirements and yet has a monstrous price.
