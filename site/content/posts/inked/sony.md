Recently purchased my first* camera - Sony &alpha; 6700. Theres an asterisk to that first as some of you may be familiar with my unsplash page or the fact that I have been taking pictures for a couple of years. Almost every previous camera that i've used was what my mother purchased back when I was a year old. In fact, my widely used Sony Rebel XSi is a year older than me. Hence this makes it my first ever camera.

<p>This <a href="/collections/inked.html">inked</a> is dated to when I made this purchase. I have however been using the camera for the past 4 months (written on 28th Sep, 2025)</p>

So far i've taken this camera with me for several trips, one of which was a short summer trip to Pondicherry with my college mates. Besides that i've sort of made it a regular thing to carry my camera around. I still find it difficult to take a camera out of my bag and start clicking pictures in the public. This is perhaps only because of how people in my country would perceive using a camera as "professional photography", and I will save my rant on this for another inked blog.

<div class="cite-block">
<p>There are a shit ton of laws that are hidden, or supposed to be "known". I find these laws on cameras pointless and unfair, just seems like an incorrect opinion on photography in general. You are somehow allowed to take pictures with your phone (modern phones are <b>more</b> than capable of taking professional grade pictures), but it becomes a problem to use a device which is designed solely for this purpose. Have almost gotten my camera confiscated twice. Once at a metro station and another at a beach. I am very careful with when I make use of the camera and only try taking pictures in an appropriate environment. The same for probably when i make use of my phone.</p>

I've never used a mirrorless camera before. Probably the one downside is loosing out on battery life compared to DSLR. I've only had to charge the old Cannon Rebel XSi once during a 10 day Singapore trip (you will probably find an inked blog on this soon, have lots of pictures from here on my [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/collections/LLxalVci9vk/sin-24-25) page), with extensive usage. Same cant be said for mirrorless as, well theres no viewfinder (yes there is a viewfinder but it uses a screen, thats the whole point of mirrorless, no mirror).

Another upgrade with the camera is the lens. I've never used anything more than a 55mm lens on my older Cannon and i've gotta say, 105mm is really handy for a couple of things. Here is me taking pictures of an Air India eXpress plane doing rounds around my sisters place in Bengaluru

Yes theres a bit of digital zoom, but you can see how close you can get to the place in the little left box below!!

I'm no expert in these things, I struggle quite a bit in low-light conditions and am yet to truly understand how to color grade my pictures ([@brendangleberries](https://www.instagram.com/brendangleberries) instagram page is probably what inspires me/the form of art that I like, but more focused towards photography than cinematography). I love doing this in my free time and trying to find ways that I can improve. Theres something different about the felling of taking pictures on these cameras. I love capturing the moment that I see before my eyes, and keep them forever (always have been known for hoarding memories with myself, my parents love complaining about this). And I hope to share more milestones that i've come across here with this little hobby of mine (I'm apparently in the top 25% of contributors in unsplash but thats probably not alot)

Shameless plug to [@adihegde](https://unsplash.com/@adihegde). Almost 400k views!!!

Anyways, I have a lot to share, i'll probably update this inked blog, or make a few more as and when I plan to share more cool pics or things I come across while learning (if I get the time, 3rd year is loaded with too many assignments). Thanks for reading this blog (and please do go like my posts on unsplash :D)
