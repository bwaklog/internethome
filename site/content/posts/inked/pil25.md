Interned at [PIL](https://www.theinnovationlab.in) (aka. PES Innovation Lab (prev. Microsoft Innovation Lab (prev. Nokia Innovation Lab))) for 8 weeks during the Summer of 2025. This is a research lab based of in the main PESU Campus. The problem statements we choose to work on are created by seniors and alumni from the lab. My research involved introducing a preemptive task scheduler to MCUs(Microcontroller Units). Our scheduler is built around the Raspberry Pi Pico, which comes with a dual core ARM-Cortex M0+ processor. Our implementation introduces a novel approach in loading compiled programs at runtime via a serial interactive interface which is designed to control the status of the tasks loaded on the board.

This project involved several blockers that took weeks to tackle, such as implementing preemptive context switching (which would be the foundation to the entire "_operating system_") proved to be a challenging task. Will be updating more on the implementation when I get the time.

These 8 weeks has definitely been an experience to say the least. Learnt several lessons as an outcome of this. This also came up in parallel to my first few weeks as being the part of the core team of [HSP](https://hsp-ec.xyz) so managing my time between to things that I am held accountable to, while probably not being my first, has definitely been the bigger challenge for me. This is probably because our results took quite a lot of time compared to the other teams in the lab, which did add to my stress personally, but it was a process I enjoyed.
