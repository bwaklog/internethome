# Profiling with Go

> by [Swapnil Nakade]()

## Points covered

- Using [net/http/pprof](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/pprof) with go to profile either the CPU, memory or block profiling
- Visualisation of profiling using either the CLI, web flow diagram or flame graph
- Breaking down the code with profiling and finding places to improve performance
