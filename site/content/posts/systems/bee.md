A distributed bit-cask like LS Hash Table KV Store. Or according to my first, definitely not force pushed commit `4a141713` on _Mon Sep 23 00:31:41 2024 +0530_

> snowflk is a distributed kv store inspired from bitcask's implementation of a Log-Structured Hash Table, focusing on replicated storage of persistent data across nodes

This is another shot of me dipping my toes in rust, which was not the initial plan. Go seemed easy, but I wanted to learn something new along the way as well. May not be a _log_ of progress considering academics and club related work, wanted to try some stuff out :)

_writing this log right before a test, might be messy_
