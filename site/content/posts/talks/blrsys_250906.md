# Overview

For those who aren't aware [Bengaluru Systems](https://hasgeek.com/bengalurusystemsmeetup), 
is a really cool community of systems enthusiasts here in Bengaluru, India. 
The meetups cover insightful talks on distributed systems, databases, compilers, 
and more! It was created back in May 2024 by some amazing folks like 
[Madhav](https://nonmonotonic.dev) and [Rowjee](https://rowjee.com/).

This edition introduced a lightning talk format where all of us were given the 
opportunity to present what we have been working on or what we found interesting.

This event saw several lightning talks including ones given by [Navin](https://navinshrinivas.com)
(who spoke about his Torrent client in Rust) and [Sudhir](https://anirudhsudhir.com/) who spoke 
about his findings and research on [Swiss Tables](https://abseil.io/about/design/swisstables), 
which are used by [Go 1.24](https://go.dev/blog/swisstable), [Valkey](https://valkey.io/blog/new-hash-table/), 
and Rustâ€™s port of Google's Swiss table [hashbrown](https://github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown).

## My talk on [Quaso](posts/systems/bee)

During the event, I was given the opportunity to present an old project of mine - Quaso 
(a Raft implementation in Rust). During this presentation, I gave a 
basic overview of how Raft leader election works and how new entries to a log 
are replicated across a cluster. The presentation concluded with a short demo on 
leader elections and re-elections, simulating append entries, and a demo with a 
basic Key-Value store.

I spoke about how my current implementation works, how it can be extended to 
have consensus over any serializable type in Rust. I touched upon my previous 
implementation which made use of Google's [tarpc](https://github.com/google/tarpc) 
crate in Rust, and the issues that came up with it.

This was my first individual talk, and my first in a while (the last one being 
my presentation for [anna](https://github.com/anna-ssg/anna) at 
[GoLang Bengaluru #76](/posts/talks/gomeet_76.html)).
