## Hey! I'm Hegde 🌊

Welcome to my home on the internet!

![Image of me as a kid](/static/me.jpeg)

I love exploring challenging problems, its what keeps me working.

On this site I will be sharing my journey, my zettels' and projects along with a random [photo dump](/clicks.html)

🏫 Currently pursuing my bachelors degree in CSE at PES Uni. Also a part of clubs like [HSP](https://homebrew.hsp-ec.xyz/about/) and [ACM](https://acmpesuecc.github.io) here at my uni and part of both the *Mentoring* and *Design* team.

I'm really interested in working with system level, databases, networking concepts and growing fondly of _quantum physics_.

Currently reasearching on *Databases* and *Distributed Systems* 🕗. Working on a few projects in go and trying to get my way around rust.

## Projects i've worked on

- Building [meerkat](https://github.com/bwaklog/meerkat) which forms a p2p distributed data synchronisation between nodes to serve as a foundation for future distributed projects.
- Working on [anna](https://github.com/acmpesuecc/anna), a blazingly fast ssg written in go
- [Net Nest](https://github.com/bwaklog/pleasebekind) providing a ML model for hate speech analysis for social media filters
- [xkcd grab](https://github.com/bwaklog/xkcd-grab) being a unique xkcd cli application with fuzzy matching, web scraping and using local LLM to summaries comic snippets from images alone
- [yake](https://github.com/bwaklog/yake) a minimal programming language written in C, making users perform arithmetic and printing operations with pointers

You can find my work stashed in my repositories at [github/bwaklog](https://github.com/bwaklog).

Besides the written content, I like taking pictures, so you might as well come across a few at the [clicks](/clicks.html) page. Also really love playing guitar :D
