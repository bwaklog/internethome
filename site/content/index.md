Welcome to my home on the internet 🌊

I love exploring challenging problems, its what keeps me working.

On this site I will be sharing my journey, my zettels' and projects along with a random [photo dump](/clicks.html)

🏫 Currently pursuing my bachelors degree in CSE at PES Uni. Also a part of clubs like [HSP](https://homebrew.hsp-ec.xyz/about/) and [ACM](https://acmpesuecc.github.io) here at my uni and part of both the _Mentoring_ and _Design_ team.

I'm really interested in working with system level, databases, networking concepts and growing fondly of _quantum physics_. I'm a really huge fan of Tennis and Motersport.

Currently reasearching on _Databases_ and _Distributed Systems_ 🕗. Working on a few projects in go and trying to get my way around rust. Working on the `MIT 6.5640 lab` for distributed systems.

## Projects i've worked on

-   Building [meerkat](https://github.com/bwaklog/meerkat) which forms a p2p distributed data synchronisation between nodes to serve as a foundation for future distributed projects.
-   Working on [anna](https://github.com/acmpesuecc/anna), a blazingly fast ssg written in go
-   [Net Nest](https://github.com/bwaklog/pleasebekind) providing a ML model for hate speech analysis for social media filters
-   [xkcd grab](https://github.com/bwaklog/xkcd-grab) being a unique xkcd cli application with fuzzy matching, web scraping and using local LLM to summaries comic snippets from images alone
-   [yake](https://github.com/bwaklog/yake) a minimal programming language written in C, making users perform arithmetic and printing operations with pointers

You can find my work stashed in my repositories at [github/bwaklog](https://github.com/bwaklog).

Besides the written content, I like taking pictures, so you might as well come across a few at the [clicks](/clicks.html) page. Also really love playing guitar :D

## Getting started
