The idea is quite simple.

> Network I/O operations are **SLOW** & Memory operations are simply **FAST**

Having a TCP accepting multiple connections and execution done through a single thread. Redis relies on the speed of *in-memory* operations. Single threaded processes drops the need of using a locking mechanism.

IO Multiplexing deals with handling multiple TCP connections *concurrently*. It handles all executions in a sequential fashion & Redis is capable of supporting a *large* number of these TCP connections.
