- [Google Docs]() using the same implementation
- [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) enabling **real time** communication : server less approach. More of a P2P approach
- [MPL](https://github.com/automerge/mpl) P2P Document synchronisation system for automerge
- Think about [Web Sockets]() for client/server communications
# Notes
- [[Json like abstraction in Automerge]] for application data.
- [[K-V Store implementation]] for the database side of the application
