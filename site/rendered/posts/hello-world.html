            <p>I'm not usually great at these things, but I want to give it a try. So here it goes.</p>
<p>Hey There! My name is Aditya Hegde and this is my small space on such a vast land of the web. What about me? Well, I'm a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=College%20Freshman">freshman</a> at PES University. Parts of some cool clubs such as <a href="https://homebrew.hsp-ec.xyz/">HSP</a> and <a href="https://acmpesuecc.github.io/">ACM</a> which was my first little family here in college. Besides the stressful parts of it, just the first 6 months alone have shown me a whole new world.</p>

<p>It's been a whole semester since I've joined college, and I could just go on and on about the number of amazing people I've met. It's like a whole new wave I've never experienced. Been part of one of the coolest mentoring teams, mentored in some amazing workshops, and even had the opportunity to have my presentation on one of my projects.</p>
<p>This site is special to me. Not only it is the place where I would like to share my work but also it is being generated by <a href="https://github.com/acmpesuecc/anna">anna</a>, which is one of the first big projects I've worked on with an amazing team <a href="https://github.com/anirudhsudhir">Anirudh</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DedLad">Adhesh</a> and <a href="https://github.com/polarhive">Nathan</a>. As of now, it's still a work in progress, and working on it has been great.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>failure doesn't define a person</p>

<p>I love learning new stuff. And at the same time, I don't know what to focus on. So as of now, I'd be lying if I said I'm specifically into some system-level stuff or networking concepts... Whatever it is I'd like to share it, and what better place to do so other than my page. I believe failure does make someone stronger. There are so many physicists out there, great ones who tried but failed to read some conclusions, but ended up with something new, sometimes something revolutionary. There's so much more to learn.</p>
